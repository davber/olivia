# Olivia

Olivia is a new kind of computer language, based on the idea - or
perhaps even insight - that all the various notions - meta level or
not - used in "regular programming" are merely aspects of more
fundamental (meta) notions.

One specific instance of this thought of genericity is that there is
no fundamental difference between "logic" and "data", nor, somewhat
analogously, between "compile time" and "runtime." Some of the effects
of the latter openness resembles - superficially - that found in more
script-like environments, like Python and Ruby; one core distinction
is that Olivia enables the developer (or "problem formalist") to add
compile time constraints and facts about things that might live beyond
"compilation" and such adornments are usually referred to as "types"
in computer languages, thus making Olivia **potentially** analogous to
a statically typed language.

Olivia was conceived by David Bergman, during the period of 1987 to
2012; a slow process indeed, but hopefully the fruition is useful to somebody.

There is more information about Olivia on the Wiki pages for this
GitHub project.

Enjoy!
